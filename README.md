# Queryhandler-
/* Problem Statement:
 Sudesh Sharma is a Linux expert who wants to have an online system where he can handle student queries. 
 Since there can be multiple requests at any time,
 he wishes to dedicate a fixed amount of time (i.e. Time Quantum) to every request so that everyone gets a fair share of his time. //i.e. Round Robin algo
 He will log into the system from 10am to 12am only. (i.e. 10:00 AM to 11:59 AM (both including))
 He wants to have separate requests queues for students and faculty. Implement a strategy for the same.
